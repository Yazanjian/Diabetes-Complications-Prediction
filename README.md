# Diabetes-Complications-Prediction
- Diabetes mellitus, or diabetes for short, is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.
Diabetes has two main types called Type 1 and Type 2. In Type 1, also known as insulin-dependent or childhood-onset, there is a deficiency in producing insulin in the body that requires daily administration of insulin, whereas in diabetes Type 2, known formally as non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset, the body cannot use the insulin effectively. It is worth mentioning that diabetes Type 2 is the most common type in patients
Diabetes can affect any part of the body over time. For example, diabetes can lead to different complications such as metabolic syndrome (a cluster of metabolic disorders), dyslipidemia (an abnormal amount of lipids in the blood), neuropathy (nerve damage), nephropathy (disease of the kidneys) and much more. 

- In this work, we are studying 8 different complications, namely: Metabolic Syndrome, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension,Obesity, Neuropathy, Nephropathy, DiabeticFoot, and Retinopathy,

- Stratified k-fold cross validation was used in this study.
